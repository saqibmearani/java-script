    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a powerful scripting language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows developers to add features like animations, form validations, pop-up alerts, and real-time content updates. With JavaScript, websites become more user-friendly and engaging compared to static HTML pages.</p>
    <p>JavaScript works closely with HTML and CSS — HTML provides the structure of a webpage, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds behavior and functionality. It runs directly in the web browser, meaning users can interact with a website without needing to reload the page each time an action is performed.</p>
    <p>Over the years, JavaScript has evolved into one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is not only used for front-end development but also for back-end programming through environments like Node.js. From small scripts to full web applications, JavaScript plays a key role in modern web development.</p>
